## A React JS Seed / Starter Kit / Boilerplate

**This project/repo was graciously borrowed and modified from [gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate)**

Please see [Dan's awesome repo](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate) for detailed information about the origins and genesis of this build.

### Usage

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```

Now edit `scripts/App.js`.
Your changes will appear without reloading the browser like in [this video](http://vimeo.com/100010922).

### Dependencies and additions I've made to the original boilerplate

* React
* Webpack
* [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server)
* [jsx-loader](https://github.com/petehunt/jsx-loader)
* [react-hot-loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)
